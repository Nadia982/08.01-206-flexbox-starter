          I'm a frontend web developer based in London, UK, and I have been

          <h3>How did I get interested in coding?</h3>
          <p>
            I was using LinkedIn Learning to brush up on my Excel skills for
            work when I noticed there were HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses
            available too, so I started watching those and was instantly hooked!
            I then signed up for the Skillcrush bootcamp - more about that in
            the next section...
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
          <h3>How did I find out about Skillcrush?</h3>
          <p>
            I was listening to coding-related podcasts and chanced upon a
            podcast where Skillcrush founder Adda Birnir was the main guest. I
            loved the way that Adda described Skillcrush's ethos and teaching
            methodology, so I signed up immediately and haven't looked back!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
          <h3>Which other coding resources do I use?</h3>
          <p>
            As well as Skillcrush and LinkedIn Learning, I use a variety of
            resources including FreeCodeCamp, YouTube videos, CodePip, Mimo and
            Udemy to make my tech education as broad and as thorough as
            possible. I code along with the tutorials I watch to put my learning
            into practice!
